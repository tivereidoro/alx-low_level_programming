## ALX Software Engineering Task
##

### General Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
* All your files should end with a new line.
* A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory.
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables.
* No more than 5 functions per file.
* The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden.
* You are allowed to use _putchar.
* You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account.
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file.
* All your header files should be include guarded.

### Tasks
* Task[0]: Write a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list.
* Tasks[1]: Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list.
* Task[2]: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list.
* Task[3]: Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list.
* Tasks[4]: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
* Task[5]: Write a function that frees a listint_t list.
* Task[6]: Write a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head node’s data (n)
* Task[7]: Write a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.
* Task[8]: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
* Task[9]: Write a function that inserts a new node at a given position.
* Task[10]: Write a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list.
